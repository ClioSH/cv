  \opening{Dear Sir or Madam,}

  I am writing to apply for the position of \textbf{XXX}. In this letter
  I would like to briefly describe my recent work experience and my motivation
  to pursue a career in the IT industry.
  
Over the past four years, I
have worked at Pouchen Group, a leading footwear manufacturer, as a Product
Costing Supervisor at the plants in Dongguan, China, and Ho Chi Minh City,
Vietnam. I was responsible for the cooperation with a major French sporting
goods company, with the emphasis on outdoor products. % owner of multiple brands, specializing in trekking, tennis,
% cycling and technical high-performance products respectively.
During that period, I have had the opportunity to learn to solve data analytic problems of low to intermediate complexity and manage a team of ten employees.

Four years in manufacturing made me understand that one of the main
driving forces of present-day economy is an eternal pursuit of efficiency and
automation. I have noticed that although automation techniques are already commonly
implemented on the factory floor, there are still many repetitive, everyday
tasks in office work that remain to be optimized. Therefore I have decided to
learn software development to be able to automate 
day-to-day tasks and save time and money, both for my clients and for myself.

I have recently graduated from a three-month bootcamp organized by 5xRuby, a Taiwan-based
software development company specializing in Ruby on Rails.
During the course, I have learned the basics of Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS,
and ES6.
I hope my skills can make me a valuable asset for your company.

I look forward to hearing from you.
% I have become a quick learner who can acquire domain-specific knowledge.
% These experiences, along with the inspiration of my experience of SAP data migration and Industry 4.0, I have taken on the study of Web development techniques as a self-driven learner.

\closing{Yours Faithfully,\\
